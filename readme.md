# employees

## MVP

As a User, I want to have the ability to get information about employees in one request. As a Developer, I want to have an async web App with document-oriented DB:

The App should:
* have one API method
* be async
* build using FastAPI and MongoDB
* covered by tests
* work in Docker container
